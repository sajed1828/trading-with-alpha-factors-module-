# ðŸ§  Clever Trade Bot: Alpha Factor-based Bitcoin Prediction

This is a sample trading model that uses **LSTM** and **Transformer** architectures to predict Bitcoin trends and future prices based on **alpha factors** and **technical indicators**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- Uses historical **Bitcoin data**.
- Incorporates **alpha factors** and **indicators** to generate predictive signals.
- Applies deep learning models like:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (**LSTM**)
  - Transformer encoder model

You can explore how we extract and apply alpha factors to predict both the **trend** and the **next price** of Bitcoin.

We were inspired by research like:

- **Zero Factors 101**:

  _This paper helps build a conceptual roadmap for factor-based trading._
